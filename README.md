# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python's Pygame library. 

In this game, you control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself.

## Game Controls

- **Arrow Keys** - Control the snake’s movement
- **C** - Restart the game after a game-over
- **Q** - Quit the game after a game-over

## Requirements

To run this game, you’ll need to have Python 3 installed along with the Pygame library.

### Install Pygame

```bash
pip install pygame
